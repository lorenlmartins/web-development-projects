## What is CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML documents. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page.

## Basic Structure of a CSS File:
- A CSS file usually has a `.css` extension.
- Style rules consist of selectors and declarations.
- Declarations are defined within curly braces `{}` and consist of properties and values.

## Common Selectors:
- **Element Selectors**: Selects all elements of a type, such as `p`, `h1`, or `div`.
- **Class Selectors**: Begins with a dot (`.`), selecting elements with a specific class, like `.my-class`.
- **ID Selectors**: Begins with a hash (`#`), selecting an element with a specific ID, like `#my-id`.
- **Attribute Selectors**: Selects elements with a specific attribute, such as `[type="text"]`.

## Common Properties:
- **Colors**: Use `color` for text color and `background-color` for background color.
- **Font**: Control font appearance with `font-family`, `font-size`, and `font-weight`.
- **Layout**: Use `margin` and `padding` to control space around and within elements.
- **Borders**: Add borders with `border`, including `border-width`, `border-style`, and `border-color`.
- **Sizing**: Use `width` and `height` to define an element's dimensions.

## Box Model:
- Each element is represented as a rectangular box, including `margin`, `border`, `padding`, and `content`.
- The box model can be altered with the `box-sizing` property.

## Layouts:
- **Flexbox**: Used for creating flexible and responsive layouts.
- **Grid**: A powerful layout system for creating two-dimensional layouts.
