## What is HTML?
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of all web pages. It defines the structure and content of a web page using a series of elements.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document:
- Every HTML file starts with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
- The document is enclosed within `<html>` tags.
- The `<head>` section includes meta-information like the title (`<title>`) and links to CSS or JavaScript.
- The `<body>` section contains all the content that is visible on the webpage.

## Common HTML Elements:
- **Headings**: Use `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings, with `<h1>` being the largest and `<h6>` the smallest.
- **Paragraphs**: Use `<p>` for paragraphs of text.
- **Links**: Create hyperlinks using `<a href="URL">link text</a>`.
- **Images**: Embed images with `<img src="imageURL" alt="description">`.
- **Lists**: Use `<ul>` for unordered (bulleted) lists and `<ol>` for ordered (numbered) lists, with `<li>` for each list item.
- **Tables**: Create tables with `<table>`, `<tr>` (table row), `<th>` (table header), and `<td>` (table data).

## Attributes:
- Attributes provide additional information about elements. Common attributes include `href` for links, `src` for images, and `alt` for image descriptions.
- Attributes are added inside the opening tag of an element.

## Forms and Inputs:
- Forms allow users to submit data to a server. 
- Use `<form>` to create a form.
- Common input types include `<input type="text">`, `<input type="password">`, and `<input type="submit">`.
- Use `<label>` to associate a label with a form element, and `<button>` to create clickable buttons.

## Semantic HTML:
- Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` give meaning to your content and help with SEO and accessibility.

## Comments:
- You can add comments in your HTML code using `<!-- comment here -->`. Comments are not displayed on the webpage.
