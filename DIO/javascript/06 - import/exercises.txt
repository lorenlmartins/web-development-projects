1) Write a program that receives a number and prints its respective multiplication table.
    Example:
        Input:
            2

        Output:
            2x1 = 2
            2x2 = 4
            2x3 = 6
            2x4 = 8
            2x5 = 10
            2x6 = 12
            2x7 = 14
            2x8 = 16
            2x9 = 18
            2x10 = 20

2) Write a program that receives the quantity of numbers and their respective values.
Print the largest and smallest number of this set.

Example:
    Input:
        4
        100
        150
        90
        200

    Output:
        Largest number: 200
        Smallest number: 90

3) Write a program that receives the quantity of numbers and their respective values.
Print all even numbers.
Example:
    Input:
        5
        1
        3
        9
        10
        12

    Output:
        Even Numbers: 10, 12
